Credit Risk Assessment using Machine Learning – Loan Default Prediction
# Credit Risk Assessment using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting loan approval based on applicant information such as income,
loan amount, credit history, and employment details.  
The goal is to help financial institutions assess credit risk using machine learning techniques.

## Problem Statement
Banks and financial institutions face challenges in identifying applicants who are likely to
repay loans. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and error-prone.  
This project aims to build a data-driven model that predicts loan approval using historical data.

## Dataset
- Source: Loan Prediction Problem Dataset (Kaggle)
- Records include applicant demographics, income details, loan amount, credit history,
  and loan status.

## Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Training multiple classification models
5. Model evaluation and comparison
6. Hyperparameter tuning
7. Building an end-to-end ML pipeline

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- Confusion Matrix

## Current Status
- Data cleaning completed
- Project under active development

## Future Improvements
- Feature selection optimization
- Advanced ensemble models
- Deployment using a web interface
- Extension to default risk prediction

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GitHub
